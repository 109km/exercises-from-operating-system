### Q1: Use SJF and FIFO algorithms to run 3 jobs which length is 200, calculte their turnaround time and response time.

In this case, the two algorithms are the same.

```
T(turnaround) = (200 + 400 + 600) / 3 = 400
T(response) = (0 + 200 + 400) / 3 = 200
```

### Q2: Do the same thing, but jobs' lengths are different: 100,200,300

```
SJF
T(turnaround) = (100 + 300 + 600) / 3 = 333.33
T(response) = (0 + 100 + 300) / 3 = 133.33

FIFO
In this case, it depends on the jobs' order. If the order is 100->200->300, the result is the same with SJF's, on the other hand, the results are quite different. Assume order is 200->300->100:
T(turnaround) = (200 + 500 + 600) / 3 = 433.33
T(response) = (0 + 200 + 500) / 3 = 233.33
```
### Q3: Do the same thing, use RR algorithm, and time slice is 1.

```
If the 3 jobs arrive at the same time:
T(turnaround) = (598 + 599 + 600) / 3 â‰ˆ 599
T(response) = (0 + 1 + 2) / 3 = 1 
```

### Q4: To what kind of workload, the SJF and FIFO have the same turnaround time?

The jobs order is from shortest to longest.

### Q5: To what kind of workload and time slice, the SJF and RR have the same response time?

The jobs's running time equals to the time slice.

### Q6: With the increase of job's length, what kind of response time of SJF will be like? Can you simulate the trend of it with a program?

If all jobs arrive at the same time, and their running time is the same.

The response time will increase linearly.

The simulation program is in `question-06.c`.

### Q7: With the increase of time slice, what are the changes of RR's response time? Can you write an equation to calculate the worst response time under the given conditions of N working time?

Obviously the RR's reponse time will increase. 

The worst case is all jobs arrive at the same time. So only the first job can be executed at once, others will be waiting.

Assume time slice is n, in this case the average response time is : 

```
Average T(response) = 0 + n + 2n + 3n + ... + n * (N - 1)
```
